        Your short story is: <b>${ book.title }</b> by ${ book.author }
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Your short story has been borrowed from the Sirius Reader library and it will be opened on the Sirius Reader after
        you click the below button.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You can read the story at your convenience on any device with internet access by using the URL
        <mark>siriusreader.com</mark>. The Sirius Reader will save your progress and bookmark your place in the short story so
        you can log out and back in any time you want.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        In the right-hand corner menu you can find a timer that tells you how much time you have left to read the short
        story before it is automatically returned to the Sirius Reader library. If you finish reading the story early,
        you can return it before the due date by clicking 'finish reading'. Note that returning the story early means
        that you can no longer go back to it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        After your story has been returned to the Sirius Reader library, you will be redirected to two final questionnaires. You
        have 2 days to answer to both questionnaires after the story reading due date has passed. Once you have finished
        the questionnaires, the experimenter will contact you to arrange the payment of compensation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You can withdraw from the study at any point without loss of compensation by selecting 'withdraw' from the menu.
        From the same menu you can also access the information form at any time during the study.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Note that the e-reader background colour in Sirius Reader is gray. This is to enhance reading comfort.
