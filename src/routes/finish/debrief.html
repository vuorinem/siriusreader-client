      <h1>Recreational Reading Behaviour</h1>

        The purpose of the experiment is to observe adults' reading behaviour during recreational, electronic reading
        and enhance our understanding of how motivation and interest influence that reading behaviour. We pursued to
        manipulate your motivation to read the short story by randomly assigning you an interesting or an uninteresting
        story on the basis of your interest-ratings for the summaries at the beginning of the study. You were assigned
        to the ${ isIntrinsic ? 'former' : 'latter' } condition, and therefore you received the story of which summary
        you rated as ${ isIntrinsic ? 'most' : 'least' } interesting.

        The Sirius Reader allows the observation of reading behaviour by tracking the frequency of your page turns and
        disengagements from the story, which devices you used for reading, and the timing and duration of your reading
        sessions. Questionnaires were used to assess your general reading habits as well as your opinions on the story
        you read during the study.

        Previous research has shown that a high reading ability is critical for financial, academic and social success
        (Rapp, Van Den Broek, McMaster, Kendeou, &amp; Espin, 2007), and frequency of recreational reading has been
        recognised as a robust predictor of reading skills (McGeown, Duncan, Griffiths, &amp; Stothard, 2015; Mol &amp;
        Bus, 2011; Twist, Schagen, &amp; Hodgson, 2007). Despite of its importance, 36% of adults and 44% of young
        adults do not read for pleasure (Department for Culture, Media, 2015). Avid readers tend to be intrinsically
        motivated, and so they engage in reading simply because they enjoy it as an activity (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). To
        increase intrinsically motivated recreational reading, more information is needed about what drives reading
        engagement and how individuals read in the context of their daily lives, especially on electronic devices. Our
        findings help shed light on the topic and thus provide a foundation for future research and the development of
        interventions.
