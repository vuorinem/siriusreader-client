      <h1>Recreational E-Reading Behaviour</h1>

      <h2>Debrief information</h2>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Thank you for taking the time to participate in our study!
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        The purpose of the experiment is to observe adults’ reading behaviour during recreational, electronic reading
        and enhance our understanding of how motivation and interest influence that reading behaviour. We expect
        participants who are more interested in the book they read during the study to be more likely to continue
        reading it after they receive the infographic notification and are given the opportunity to finish the study. We
        also expect to see differences in participants overall reading behaviour, such as whether they read the book
        chronologically from beginning to end, and how often they get distracted during reading.

        The Sirius Reader allows the observation of reading behaviour by tracking the frequency of your page turns and
        disengagements from the story, which devices you used for reading, and the timing and duration of your reading
        sessions. Questionnaires were used to assess your general reading habits as well as your opinions on the story
        you read during the study. We also tracked your engagement with the different books in Sirius Reader library in
        order to study if text selection behaviour (such as extensive exploration of available options) is related to
        motivation and reading behaviour.

        Previous research has shown that a high reading ability is critical for financial, academic and social success
        (Rapp, Van Den Broek, McMaster, Kendeou, &amp; Espin, 2007), and frequency of recreational reading has been
        recognised as a robust predictor of reading skills (McGeown, Duncan, Griffiths, &amp; Stothard, 2015; Mol &amp;
        Bus, 2011; Twist, Schagen, &amp; Hodgson, 2007). Despite of its importance, 36% of adults and 44% of young
        adults do not read for pleasure (Department for Culture Media and Sport, 2015). Avid readers tend to be
        intrinsically motivated, and so they engage in reading simply because they enjoy it as an activity (Deci &amp;
        Ryan, 2000). To increase intrinsically motivated recreational reading, more information is needed about what
        drives reading engagement and how individuals read in the context of their daily lives, especially on electronic
        devices. Our findings help shed light on the topic and thus provide a foundation for future research and the
        development of interventions.
