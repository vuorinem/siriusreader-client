              <b>Pauliina Vuorinen</b> is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics. The
              research project is part of her interdisciplinary PhD study on adults' recreational reading behaviours.
              She is passionate about understanding reading habits of adults such as where, when and how individuals
              read for fun in the context of their everyday lives. Her previous research projects have addressed similar
              questions on reading behaviour. Pauliina is the main point of contact in this study and she can be

              <b>Professor Frank Keller</b> is based in School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. His research
              focuses on how people solve complex tasks such as understanding language or processing visual information.
              He is experienced in using a combination of experimental techniques with computational modelling in order
              to investigate reading, sentence comprehension, translation and language generation. Prof Frank Keller is
              the first supervisor of this research project.
            </p>

              <b>Professor Ben Tatler</b> is based in School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen. He's Active Vision
              Lab studies how vision is used to provide the information we need to complete our activities of everyday

              environments, rather than exclusively in laboratory settings. Prof Ben Tatler is the second supervisor of
              this research project.

              <b>Mikko Vuorinen</b> is a professional software developer working as a developer lead in a company
              focusing on digital identity. He has extensive experience of building web applications that have high
              security standards without sacrificing usability. Mikko has created the online ereader and made it
              possible for us to gather novel data on this bespoke method.
