        <h3>Information on the research project</h3>
        <div class="accordion faq-questions">
          <nr-faq-question question="What are reading behaviours?">
            <p>
              Reading behaviour refers to where and when your reading sessions take place, and <i>how</i> you read a
              text. Readers tend to differ in how frequently they decide to engage in reading, but also in which
              locations and conditions they read, for how long, and how they advance through the text. We are interested
              in how readers differ in these behaviours. For example, how many readers read the text from beginning to
              end and how many readers skipped ahead or looked back in the text? Also, how often do readers get
              distracted when they are reading the text? Information about these reading behaviours can tell us a great
              deal about how we could support reading!
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What is the purpose of the study?">
            <p>
              Our aim is to observe reading behaviour during electronic recreational reading. This will help us
              understand how adults differ in their reading behaviour, and the information can be used to develop
              reading promotions that can effectively support adults in finding time to read in their busy lives. The
              goal of this study is to ultimately encourage reading for pleasure!
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Can I get the information sheet and/or faq in an alternative format?">
            <p>
              Yes! The research team would be happy to send you an alternative version of any information related to the
              study. Contact us with the contact form and let us know what type of a document you are looking for. Note
              that unfortunately we cannot mail any print copies.

          <nr-faq-question question="Where does the funding for this study come from?">
            <p>
              This research project is funded by ESRC SGSSS and the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics
              institute of language processing, speech technology, information retrieval and cognition.

        <h3>Taking part in the study</h3>
        <div class="accordion faq-questions">
          <nr-faq-question question="Why have I been asked to take part?">
            <p>
              We wish to recruit adults who are over the age of 18 to take part in the study.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Do I have to take part?">
            <p>
              No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. If you decide to take part, you can withdraw from
              the study at any time,
              without giving a reason. Your rights will not be affected, and you will be compensated with an infographic
              on your reading behaviour if you pass the infographic notification threshold on Sirius Reader. If you wish
              to withdraw, you can click the option ‘withdraw’ from Sirius Reader’s menu or contact the researcher or PI
              for assistance. If you withdraw consent, we will stop using your data in any publications or
              presentations. However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What happens if I decide to take part?">
            <p>
              First you will be asked to register to Sirius Reader, and shown information on the study. Then, you will
              be asked to fill
              in a consent form, two questionnaires asking about your reading habits and preferences, and complete a
              reading speed test that involves reading a short text at your natural reading speed. After the
              questionnaires and the quick test, you will be asked to select a book from Sirius Reader’s online library.
              You can
              read the book at your convenience on computers or mobile devices. While you read, your reading process
              will be tracked by Sirius Reader. The tracking does not affect the reading experience, and the data is
              stored anonymously in a
              secure database. Sirius Reader collects data whenever you use it, and it tracks, for example, your page
              turns, devices being used, and the timing of your reading sessions. When you log into Sirius Reader, you
              will be asked to report your
              location by selecting one of options such as ‘home’ or ‘public place’. If
              you would prefer not to report your location, you can choose this option in the location prompt. No
              location data is collected by Sirius Reader beyond these self-reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will receive automatic emails from Sirius Reader to remind you to read the book. Once Sirius Reader
              has collected a sufficient amount of tracking data, you will be notified with an email and a notification
              in Sirius Reader. At this stage, you can select to view an infographic on your own reading behaviour, or
              continue to read as long as you wish* and receive the infographic later. If you decide to view the
              infographic, the book you were reading will be returned to the Sirius Reader library, and you will be
              asked to answer two final questionnaires before finishing the study. The infographic will then be shown to
              you and sent to your email. Note that once
              you access the infographic, you can no longer return to reading the book. Alternatively, you can continue
              reading the book when you receive the infographic notification. Once the infographic notification has come
              up, you can stop
              reading the book and finish the study at any time. If you wish to stop reading the book before the
              infographic notification, you can choose 'Finish the study' from a menu in Sirius Reader. However, note
              that the infographic cannot be generated before the notification. Once you have
              responded to the final questionnaires, a debrief form with more information on the study and the
              infographic on your own reading behaviour will be automatically sent to your email address.

          <nr-faq-question question="What does the study include?">
            <p>
              The study includes registering to use Sirius Reader, responding to 4 questionnaires on separate occassions
              (two at the beginning, two at the end of the study), completing a short reading speed test to measure your
              baseline reading speed, selecting a book from Sirius Reader's online library, and reading the book fully
              or until you receive a notification on Sirius Reader that the infographic is ready to be viewed.

          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Can I take part outside the UK?">
            <p>
              Yes, we welcome all adults over the age of 18 to take part. Note that all books included in the study are
              in English, and we recommend that you take part only if you feel confident to read in English.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Are the books in English?">
            <p>
              Yes, unfortunately we are unable to include books in other languages in this study.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What information does the ereader collect?">
            <p>
              Sirius Reader observes your reading behaviour with embedded tracking features. It tracks events, for
              example the timings of page turns, interaction with elements in Sirius Reader, or when the browser window
              is closed. Sirius Reader collects information about which device you are using and how large your browser
              window is in order to dynamically organise the text.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Is the ereader secure to use?">
            <p>
              Yes, Sirius Reader has been developed specifically for this research project with participants' security
              in mind. The data is stored in a secure database anonymously, which means that it cannot be linked to you
              or any of your personal information. Your login details are stored separately in an encrypted form,
              meaning that no one can access your email address or password.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Do I get paid for participating?">
            <p>
              This study does not include monetary compensation and therefore you do not get paid for participating.
              However, we will compensate you with an infographic on your own reading behaviour if you decide to take
              part and read your selected book until the infographic can be generated.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What compensation do I get if I participate in the study?">
            <p>
              You can receive an infographic on your own reading behaviour as compensation for taking part in the study.
              The infographic includes fun statistics from the data that we collect - you can find out how your reading
              process changed at different parts of the text, when you read the most, and what your questionnaire
              answers can tell about your reading motivation.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="How do you get the infographic?">
            <p>
              The infographic can be accessed after you receive a notification that it is ready to be generated (usually
              after 70 pages of reading). Once you have answered the final two questionnaires in the study, you will be
              shown the infographic. The infographic will also be sent to the email address you used to register to the
              study as a pdf document.

              presentations. Quotes or key findings will be anonymized: We will remove any information that could, in
              our assessment, allow anyone to identify you. With your consent, information can also be used for future
              research. Your data may be archived for a minimum of 2 years.
