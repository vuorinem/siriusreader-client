        <h3>Information on the research project</h3>
        <div class="accordion faq-questions">
          <nr-faq-question question="What are reading behaviours?">
            <p>
              Reading behaviour refers to where and when your reading sessions take place, and <i>how</i> you read a
              text. Readers tend to differ in how frequently they decide to engage in reading, but also in which
              locations and conditions they read, for how long, and how they advance through the text. We are interested
              in how readers differ in these behaviours. For example, how many readers read the text from beginning to
              end and how many readers skipped ahead or looked back in the text? Also, how often do readers get
              distracted when they are reading the text? Information about these reading behaviours can tell us a great
              deal about how we could support reading!
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What is the purpose of the study?">
            <p>
              Our aim is to observe reading behaviour during electronic recreational reading. This will help us
              understand how adults differ in their reading behaviour, and the information can be used to develop
              reading promotions that can effectively support adults in finding time to read in their busy lives. The
              goal of this study is to ultimately encourage reading for pleasure!

            <p>
              Yes! The research team would be happy to send you an alternative version of any information related to the
              study. Contact us with the contact form and let us know what type of a document you are looking for. Note
              that unfortunately we cannot mail any print copies.

        <h3>Taking part in the study</h3>
        <div class="accordion faq-questions">
          <nr-faq-question question="Why have I been asked to take part?">
            <p>
              We wish to recruit adults who are over the age of 18 to take part in the study.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="Do I have to take part?">
            <p>
              No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. If you decide to take part, you can withdraw from
              the study at any time,
              without giving a reason. Your rights will not be affected, and you will be compensated with an infographic
              on your reading behaviour if you pass the infographic notification threshold on Sirius Reader. If you wish
              to withdraw, you can click the option ‘withdraw’ from Sirius Reader’s menu or contact the researcher or PI
              for assistance. If you withdraw consent, we will stop using your data in any publications or
              presentations. However, we will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request.
            </p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What happens if I decide to take part?">
            <p> First you will be asked to register to Sirius Reader, and shown information on the study. Then, you will
              be asked to fill
              in a consent form, two questionnaires asking about your reading habits and preferences, and complete a
              reading speed test that involves reading a short text at your natural reading speed. After the
              questionnaires and the quick test, you will be asked to select a book from Sirius Reader’s online library.
              You can
              read the book at your convenience on computers or mobile devices. While you read, your reading process
              will be tracked by Sirius Reader. The tracking does not affect the reading experience, and the data is
              stored anonymously in a
              secure database. Sirius Reader collects data whenever you use it, and it tracks, for example, your page
              turns, devices being used, and the timing of your reading sessions. When you log into Sirius Reader, you
              will be asked to report your
              location by selecting one of options such as ‘home’ or ‘public place’. If
              you would prefer not to report your location, you can choose this option in the location prompt. No
              location data is collected by Sirius Reader beyond these self-reports.</p>
            <p> You will receive automatic emails from Sirius Reader to remind you to read the book. Once Sirius Reader
              has collected a sufficient amount of tracking data, you will be notified with an email and a notification
              in Sirius Reader. At this stage, you can select to view an infographic on your own reading behaviour, or
              continue to read as long as you wish* and receive the infographic later. If you decide to view the
              infographic, the book you were reading will be returned to the Sirius Reader library, and you will be
              asked to answer two final questionnaires before finishing the study. The infographic will then be shown to
              you and sent to your email. Note that once
              you access the infographic, you can no longer return to reading the book. Alternatively, you can continue
              reading the book when you receive the infographic notification. Once the infographic notification has come
              up, you can stop
              reading the book and finish the study at any time. If you wish to stop reading the book before the
              infographic notification, you can choose 'Finish the study' from a menu in Sirius Reader. However, note
              that the infographic cannot be generated before the notification. Once you have
              responded to the final questionnaires, a debrief form with more information on the study and the
              infographic on your own reading behaviour will be automatically sent to your email address.</p>

            <p><i>* This study draws to an end at latest in July 2022. You will be notified by email if you are in the
                middle of a book at this time.</i></p>
          </nr-faq-question>
          <nr-faq-question question="What does the study include?">
            <p>
              The study includes registering to use Sirius Reader, responding to 4 questionnaires on separate occassions
              (two at the beginning, two at the end of the study), completing a short reading speed test to measure your
              baseline reading speed, selecting a book from Sirius Reader's online library, and reading the book fully
              or until you receive a notification on Sirius Reader that the infographic is ready to be viewed.
