        <h4>Sirius Reader tracks your reading process while you use the ereader</h4>
        <p>These tracking functions include for example, timing of page turns, your reading direction, and which part of
          the text you are viewing. The tracking functions do not interfere with the reading activity.</p>
        <p>Sirius reader will send you automatic reminder emails about the study.</p>

        <h4>You will be compensated for taking part in the study with an infographic on your own reading behaviour!</h4>
        <p>Once Sirius Reader has collected a sufficient amount of tracking data, you will be notified with an email and
          a notification in Sirius Reader. At this stage, you can select to view the infographic, return the book to the
          Sirius Reader library, answer a final questionnaire and finish the study. When you access the infographic, you
          can no longer return to reading the book. Alternatively, you can continue reading the book for as long as you
          wish*. Once the infographic notification has occurred, you can stop reading the book and finish the study at
          any time.</p>
        <p>If you wish to stop reading the book before the infographic notification, you can choose 'Finish the study'
          from a menu in Sirius Reader.</p>
        <p><small>* This study draws to an end at latest in July 2022. You will be notified by email if you are in the
            middle of a book at this time.</small></p>

        <h4>Withdrawing from the study</h4>
        <p>You can withdraw from the study at any point without loss of compensation by selecting 'Withdraw' from the
          right-hand corner menu in Sirius Reader. Withdrawing from the study means that all of the tracked data and
          your account in Sirius Reader are destroyed.</p>
        <p>The infographic is generated on the basis of your reading behaviour, and unfortunately it cannot be created
          if you decide to withdraw. This is because all tracking data will be destroyed during withdrawal, and it is
          needed to generate the infographic. </p>
