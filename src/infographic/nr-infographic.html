          <p class="infotext" if.bind="readerMotivation.motivationType === 'intrinsic'">
            Your answers to the general reading motivation questionnaire at the beginning of the study indicate that you
            are intrinsically motivated to read. Intrinsically motivated readers read simply because reading is an
            enjoyable activity. They tend to read more frequently than extrinsically motivated readers who read books
            for instrumental purposes (for example to learn more on a topic or to improve reading ability). Intrinsic
            motivation to read has been associated with a high reading ability!
          </p>

          <p class="infotext" if.bind="readerMotivation.motivationType === 'competent'">
            Your answers to the general reading motivation questionnaire at the beginning of the study indicate that you
            are a highly competent reader. Reading competence is crucial for academic success, financial independence
            and overall life success.
          </p>

          <p class="infotext" if.bind="readerMotivation.motivationType === 'effortful'">
            Your answers to the general reading motivation questionnaire at the beginning of the study indicate that you
            put a lot of effort in reading. Carefully reading a text can enhance your memory for the text contents,
            however, it can difficult to keep up a leisurely reading habit if you put too much pressure on yourself.
          </p>

          <p class="infotext" if.bind="readerMotivation.motivationType === 'nonfrequent'">
            Your answers to the general reading motivation questionnaire at the beginning of the study indicate that you
            are a nonfrequent reader. Your score in 'Effort' shows that you don't pressurise yourself into reading. In
            order to develop a recreational reading habit, it is important to read voluntarily whenever you feel like
            it!
